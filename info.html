        As the school year begins anew, we find ourselves grappling with the absence of our cherished colleague, Lasha. The halls seem a little quieter, the days a bit duller. His spirit, once a beacon of light and joy in our community, now lingers only in our memories. We miss the warmth of his presence, his infectious laughter, and the kind, protective gaze that made us all feel safe and seen.

    <div id="text2" style="display: none;">
        It is said that when people part ways, it is the love and the fond memories that keep them together in spirit. As we navigate this Lasha-less world, we hold onto the hope that our paths will cross again. Until then, dear Lasha, may you find success and happiness in your new endeavor. Your spirit remains with us, lighting our way and warming our hearts. You are missed more than words can express. <br> <br>
        This website is a humble attempt to express our deep affection and longing for you. Though it may not bring you back (DISCLAIMER: This website cannot actually bring people back), it is a place for us to come together, share our memories, and keep your spirit alive in our hearts. If you wish to join us in this virtual embrace, cast your vote and let's bring Lasha back, if only in spirit.
