            As school began, we came to the painful realization of how much we miss our beloved school member, Lasha. Coming to school and not seeing his happy and protective face is the worst feeling in the world. We have lost a truly valuable person. May he find happiness in his new job. The entire school wishes him a bright future and good health. We miss you, Lasha.
